In this study the term ‘creative industries’ includes those industries that have at their core creativity, communication, and the generation of intellectual property.

The table below (adapted from the [United Nations’ framework for cultural domains](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/doc10/BG-FCS-E.pdf)) provides an indicative, rather than comprehensive, guide to the creative industries included in this study.

Along with a comprehensive assessment of the ACT creative industries, this project will produce an interactive map with future multimodal potential.

The _ACT Creative Industries: Economic, Environmental and Policy Assessment_ is an ACT Government and University of Canberra partnership.

It draws on the expertise of academics across four University of Canberra Research Centres.

The **Centre for Creative and Cultural Research** brings together staff, adjuncts, research students and visiting fellows who work on key challenges within the cultural sector and creative field. Cross-cutting research themes include creative interventions for sustainable futures, creative practice and health, and Indigenous narratives and inclusion.
